  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section below.
  assets:
    - assets/images/ # If you have images in this folder
    - assets/sounds/ # This is where your sound files are expected to be

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: KhmerOS
